 *
 * A minimalistic Redux store for Angular 2. This class is meant to demonstrate how Redux can be integrated with Angular 2.
 *
 * This class is meant to be sub-classed per project, and a redux store needs to be passed in the constructor.
 *
 * This class then needs to be passed to the root bootstrap call of the application, so that the store can be
 * injected in any part of the application that needs it.
 *
 * The redux API methods getState(), dispatch() and subscribe() are exposed directly.
